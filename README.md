# Python-College-Project
These files are my first push on github.

These files are nothing but my 1st Sem Python College Project Which Scrapes Flight Data of 3-5 flights from MakeMyTrip.com and sends the information to the user's Gmail ID.

The mini_project.py is the main file and it contains some images and a database which is only in my computer. So please dont copy-paste and run the code directly :)
